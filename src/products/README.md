# Product Integrations

This directory is for product-specific UI or integrations (e.g., Chrome extension, web dashboard, mobile app, etc.).

- Each product should have its own folder.
- Product code should import and use the core logic from `../core/`.
- Keep UI and integration logic separate from core functionality.
