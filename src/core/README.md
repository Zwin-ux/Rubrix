# Core Logic

This directory contains the core, product-agnostic logic for formatting, grading, and internationalization. You can import and use this logic in any UI or integration (web, extension, desktop, etc.).

- Keep all logic here free of UI and product-specific code.
- Expose clear APIs for formatting, grading, and language switching.
